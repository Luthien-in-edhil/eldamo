      <h1>Black Speech</h1>
      <p>A language devised by Sauron for his servants to use (LotR/1131). Much of the languages of the Orcs was derived from Black
         Speech, but Orcish languages degraded so rapidly that the speech of different tribes had little in common; they were usually
         forced to use <a href="lang-wes.html">Westron</a> to communicate with Orcs of other tribes. Tolkien disliked working on such an “evil” language and there are few words available.
         Most of what is known about it comes from the phrases of the <i><a href="../words/word-3051450653.html">Ring Inscription</a></i>. This lexicon lumps Black Speech together with the attested Orcish words and names.
