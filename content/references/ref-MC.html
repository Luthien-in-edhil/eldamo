      <p>
         <p>Unfinished.</p>
         
         <p>A book of essays written by Tolkien. Of greatest interest is “A Secret Vice”, a speech given by Tolkien in 1931 about his
            linguistic inventions. This essay has several early Elvish poems, including “The Last Ark”, also known as “Markirya”. There
            is additional linguistic information in the notes following the essay.
         </p>
         
         <p>The notes on the article include a later version of the poem, written in the last decade of Tolkien’s life (mid to late 1960’s).</p>
